UFC Fight Pick App

It's fight week!!! And that means it's time to make your Draftkings picks for
this Saturdays fight card. But I'm tired of going back and forth from my
Draftkings app and clicking through Sherdog.com for fighter stats and info.
What would be nice is if there was one place to look at all upcoming fights and
easily compare the fighter stats of an upcoming match-up.

The Fight-Pick App will let you :

* Make fighter to fighter comparisons based on stats, records, and betting odds.

* Organize all your fight picks in a user list.

In the future this app could be expanded to:

* Tallies your record of wins or losses picked.

* Calculate your picks based on the Draftkings salary cap.

* Provide tips for improving your fight picks.
